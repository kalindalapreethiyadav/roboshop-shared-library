# roboshop-shared-library

This the shared Library where I store all the common functions of different project diferent pipeline's functions in "Shared Library"

Sharable libraries available to any Pipeline jobs running on this system. These libraries will be trusted, meaning they run without “sandbox” restrictions and may use @Grab.
